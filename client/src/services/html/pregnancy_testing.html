        <h2>Pregnancy Testing</h2>
      </div>
      <p>ZoeCare offers <em>free</em> pregnancy tests that are 99% accurate. You will be provided
        with the result of your pregnancy test including a verification form you may take with
        you. If you have a positive pregnancy test, you may schedule a <em>free</em> ultrasound to
        determine the status of your pregnancy.</p>
      <p>There are three viable pregnancy tests, including:</p>
      1.
      <a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#pregnancy-testing-urine">
        Urine Testing
      </a>
      <div id="pregnancy-testing-urine" class="collapse">
        <div class="accordion-inner">
	  Urine Testing is offered <em>free</em> at ZoeCare. Home testing can be done with the
	  purchase of a pregnancy testing kit at drug stores, most grocery stores, and some
	  department stores.  The cost is about $10 to $20.  Accuracy varies depending on how long it
	  has been since your last menstrual period and the accuracy of the test.  The urine testing
	  at ZoeCare is 99% accurate, even if your menstrual period is one day late.  The test can
	  sometimes indicate a pregnancy prior to noticing a late period.
        </div>
      </div>
      2.
      <a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#pregnancy-testing-blood">
        Blood Testing
      </a>
      <div id="pregnancy-testing-blood" class="accordion-body collapse">
        <div class="accordion-inner">
	  The blood test is called serum beta hCG.  It measures the same hormone that the urine test
	  measures.  The cost is about $50.  It will indicate a pregnancy only a day or two sooner
	  than the urine testing.  A serum beta hCG test must be ordered by a physician.  To be
	  completely accurate in determining a viable (heart motion and/or living embryo) pregnancy,
	  two blood tests must be done about two or three days apart, which doubles the cost.
	  ZoeCare offers this testing at no charge, but <em>only</em> after certain criteria have
	  been met. Those criteria can only be determined by an ultrasound.  This is very rare.
	  Blood testing for routine pregnancy confirmation is not medically indicated.

      3.
      <a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#pregnancy-testing-ultrasound">
        Ultrasound
      </a>
      <div id="pregnancy-testing-ultrasound" class="accordion-body collapse">
        <div class="accordion-inner">
	  <p>ZoeCare offers <em>free</em> limited obstetrical ultrasounds with the medical purpose of
	    confirming a viable pregnancy.  A limited ultrasound is recommended because the urine
	    test can be positive for up to two weeks even when a miscarriage has occurred.  An
	    ultrasound is a medical procedure using sound waves to view a pregnancy.  It is painless
	    and has been used in obstetrics for over 40 years without harm or ill effect to mother or
	    baby.</p>
	  <p>If you are considering an abortion an ultrasound will answer two important
	    questions:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>It will confirm a viable pregnancy.  This is important because there is no need to
	      pay for an abortion, or undergo the emotional and physical trauma experienced by many
	      women who abort, if you have incurred a natural miscarriage.  One in five early
	      pregnancies end in a natural miscarriage.</li>
	    <li>An ultrasound will provide accurate dating of the pregnancy.  Accurate age of the
	      baby is important when you are considering an abortion, because it will help determine
	      what type of abortion is medically necessary.  There may be a considerable difference
	      in cost between a chemical (medication/pills) and a surgical abortion.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>The ultrasounds at ZoeCare are performed by registered nurses with advanced ultrasound
	    (sonographer) training.  All ZoeCare ultrasounds are reviewed by a medical doctor.</p>

	    I already tested posive at home and just want an ultrasound. Now what?
	  </a>
	  <div id="pregnancy-testing-already-positive" class="collapse">
	    <div class="accordion-inner">
	      If you have taken a home pregnancy test prior to your appointment and tested positive,
	      we still require you to take a pregnancy test at ZoeCare. Our pregnancy tests are more
	      accurate than most home tests because they are medical quality tests.  It is important
	      for us to confirm your pregnancy as well as the approximate gestational age of your
	      child prior to performing an ultrasound test.
