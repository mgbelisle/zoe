        <h2>STD/STI Testing</h2>
        Sexually Transmitted Disease/Infection (STD/I)
      </div>
      <p>All sexually active individuals that are not in a monogamous relationship should be tested
        for a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and/or a sexually transmitted disease (STD).  If
        you are sexually active and have more than one partner you are at risk for STIs. STIs are
        very common.</p>
      <p>We are currently testing for
        both <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/gon-fact-sheet-june-2012.pdf" zoe-href>gonorrhea</a>
        and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/chlam-fact-sheet-dec-2012.pdf" zoe-href>chlamydia</a>
        at no cost to the patient. There are many different types of STIs. Call and talk to our
        nurse to determine the type of test you need.</p>
      <p>Statistically 1 in 3 people who have had more than one sex partner will be diagnosed with
        an STI each year. The CDC estimates the total number of STD's in the U.S. at 110 million
        infections, costing almost $16 billion annually in medical expenses.</p>
      <p>Most STD's are asymptomatic, therefore the majority of people who have an STD don't know
        they're infected.  If untreated these infections can cause numerous health issues including
        infertility, PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease), cancer and/or other complications or
        diseases.</p>
