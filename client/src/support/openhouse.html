      <p>Please join us for the ZoeCare Open House, Thursday, April 23 from 3-7pm. Ribbon cutting at 4pm. Refreshments provide. Come and see how your partnership with zoe is making a difference in Gallatin County.</p>
      <p>The Open House will also feature a showing of original oil paintings by husband and wife artists Michael and Meagan Blessing, on display and open for public viewing at ZoeCare beginning April 23 and running through June. The show, entitled "power and Grace II", will feature Meagan's vibrant and dynamic renditions of horses, and Michael's candid and contemporary figurative work.</p>
      <p>Meagan is drawn to high contrast and movement when choosing her compositions.  Years of hands on experience with horses in various capacities have resulted in paintings that are reflective of individual equine temperaments and personalities.  Meagan's love of the wide open spaces and lifestyle of the rural West coupled with her passion for all things equine is evident in her lively, expressionistic paintings.</p>
      <p>Michael is primarily compelled by the shapes within a composition.  Having discovered an initial inclination toward figurative painting, he favors a candid view of his subjects, often depicting unexpected everyday moments and emotions that are universally relevant.</p>
      <p>Both Blessings are self-taught artists working in oil, and feature strong compositions, high chroma, and bold lines in their paintings.</p>
      <p>Get a foretaste of the Blessings work at <a href="http://blessingfineart.com/recentWorks_michael.html" zoe-href>http://blessingfineart.com/recentWorks_michael.html</a></p>
      <p>We hope you will be able to join us!</p>
