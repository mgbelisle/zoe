<p>Lisa was born in Michigan and grew up in upstate NY and Ohio. She received her BSN from Fresno
State University in 1990 and enjoyed working in several ER's in Central CA. When she and her family
moved to Bozeman, she spent many years as a homeschooling Mom and serving in a variety of ministry
areas particularly with young children. Last year God led Lisa to begin volunteering with Zoe Care.
She immediately felt in sync with Zoe's mission and with the great staff and volunteers. Recently
Lisa completed the training to begin performing ultrasounds. She looks forward to working as a
member of Zoeâ€™s nursing staff to impact lives with the love of Jesus and is humbled to be a part of
this life affirming organization!</p>
