	    Yes! You can get pregnant the first time you have sex. There are only a few days a
	    month that you are actually fertile.  If you have intercourse slightly before or during
	    those days, the chance of pregnancy can occur. If you want to find out when you are
	    most fertile come in and talk to one of our nurses. There are also many websites and
	    books that help you learn more about your body's fertility by monitoring your period,
	    body temperature as well as your mucus.

	    Sometimes tests simply do not take (perform) correctly. It could be that your hCG

	    Abortion is a medical procedure (resulting in death of the fetus (baby)). With any
	    surgical or chemical abortion, there are associated physical and mental risks. Studies
	    suggest an increased risk of breast cancer later in life; other studies suggest that
	    women with reservations prior to getting an abortion will often suffer from Post
	    Abortion Syndrome (or PAS). Even if you're already committed to having an abortion,
	    don't rush in as you may not need it! About 25% of all pregnancies end naturally. Why
