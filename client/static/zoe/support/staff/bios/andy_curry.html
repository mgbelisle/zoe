<p>Andy joined ZoeCare in early 2014 as director for the newly initiated Man UP program.  Coming
into ZoeCare as the sole male staff member has been interesting, but not overwhelming for Andy as
he transitions.</p>
<p>Andy and his family have experienced time and time again, the mercy God has poured out on them
and look to pass that on to others.  Both he and his wife have experience working with non-profits
and are well accustomed to the challenges they present.</p>
<p>As the Man UP Director, Andy is in a position to speak to the man that comes through the door;
encouraging him to take responsibility for his part in an unplanned pregnancy.</p>
