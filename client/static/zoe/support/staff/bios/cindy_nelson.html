member of the ZoeCare team wearing many service hats here at Zoe, including patient advocate,
office manager, and donor enhancement. Cindy is currently the ZoeCare Development Director.</p>
<p>Cindy wholeheartedly believes her Father God led and called her to serve at ZoeCare. She will
tell you she tried to deny His calling for many years, but was continually being pulled to serve at
Zoe. She affirms she has learned so much since entering Zoe as a volunteer and now as staff. God
continues to stretch, pull and mold her to be the woman He desires.</p>
