  <h3>Event Summary</h3>
  <p>Welcome to the ZoeCare 'STACHE DASH Road & Trail Race. The 1ST Annual 3, 5 & 10k 'STACHE 
    DASH will support ZoeCare's Man UP and WAIT Training programs.</p>
  <p>The 'STACHE DASH couples perfectly with these new programs. Man UP has embarked upon a 
    fatherhood initiative and male mentoring campaign entitled "Taking Back the Beard." An unplanned 
    pregnancy can be as unsettling for a new 'father to be' as it is for young mothers. Man UP helps men 
    find their voice in unplanned pregnancies. We offer mentoring and parenting tools, what masculinity 
    means and an opportunity for men to step up and into their new fatherhood role.</p>
  <p>WAIT Training is a relationship training curriculum designed for 7th through 9th grade public school 
    students. It helps young people gain relationship skills and tools and addresses issues like bullying, 
    sexting, pornography, self-esteem, boundaries and sexual integrity.</p>

  <h3>Event Details</h3>
  <p>The 'STACHE DASH consists of three separate distances: 3K Walk, and 5K & 10K runs. Race[s] 
    begin at Bogert Park, 9am, Saturday, June 28. The course covers trail on both Pete's Hill and the 
    Bozeman Trail system.</p>
