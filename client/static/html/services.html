      <h4 id="services-ultrasounds"><em>Free</em> Limited Ultrasounds</h4>
      <p>Not sure what to do about an unplanned pregnancy? Considering abortion? It’s important to
	have an ultrasound before you decide. An ultrasound will let you know (gestational age) how
	far along you are in the pregnancy. Gestational age determines the types of abortions
	available. An ultrasound can also indicate if you may have a natural miscarriage or if your
	pregnancy is ectopic, (outside of the womb), which can be life threatening.  Make an
	appointment for a free pregnancy test today.</p>
