    </div>
    <p>ZoeCare is a faith-based, Christian, nonprofit, 501(c)3 charitable organization established to provide
      accurate, up to date information to our clients regarding their sexual health. We offer confidential,
      compassionate, education, options counseling and treatment. All ZoeCare client services are offered
      FREE of charge.</p>
    <p>We provide FREE pregnancy testing, limited ultrasound, STD/STI testing and treatment, contraception 
      information, options counseling including adoption, parenting, and abortion facts and information. We 
      do not provide contraceptives nor do we refer for abortions.</p>
    <p>ZoeCare, located in beautiful Bozeman, Montana, was first established in 1978 as the Pregnancy Caring 
      Center of Gallatin County. The center was established as an abortion alternative center to affirm 
      women in their right to know all the facts and options available when they were facing an unintended 
      pregnancy.</p>
    <p>Our primary mission is to serve the mother and save the child with medical excellence in the love of 
      CHRIST. It is our desire that no woman or man facing an unplanned pregnancy will have to know or 
      experience the anguish and trauma born of the decision to abort their child.</p>
