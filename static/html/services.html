  <h4>FREE Pregnancy Tests</h4>
  <p>Confirm you are really pregnant before you decide what to do about an unplanned pregnancy. If you got a positive result 
    on an in-home pregnancy test, you should take a medical-quality pregnancy test at ZoeCare. Our free pregnancy tests 
    are 99% accurate. Our test detects the pregnancy hormone, hCG, at about the time of your first missed period.</p>
  <h4>Free Limited Ultrasound</h4>
  <p>Not sure what to do about an unplanned pregnancy? Considering abortion? It’s important to have an ultrasound before 
    you decide. An ultrasound will let you know (gestational age) how far along you are in the pregnancy. Gestational age 
    determines the types of abortions available. An ultrasound can also indicate if you may have a natural miscarriage or 
    if your pregnancy is ectopic, (outside of the womb), which can be life threatening.  Make an appointment for a free 
    pregnancy test today.<p>

  <p>ZoeCare provides FREE testing and treatment for both chlamydia and gonorrhea. Testing is done at the first 
    appointment. A second appointment is scheduled for you to receive the results of the test. If positive, medication for 
    treatment is given at that time.</p>
