      <h2>Selfless Love</h2>
      A Teen Mom Chooses Life and Adoption
    </div>
    <p>Fiona Bennett is passionate about life. “Who is Fiona Bennett and what’s the big deal?” I’m
      glad you asked. Fiona is currently a senior at Bozeman High School. She’s a varsity
      cheerleader for both football and volleyball, co-manager of the Lady Hawks basketball team,
      and plans to become an ER nurse. Fiona is also the birth mother of a beautiful baby girl born
      to herself and her boyfriend, on April 10, 2013, and adopted by a Bozeman couple.</p>
    <p>Fiona has graciously offered to share the story of her experience as a teen facing an
      unplanned pregnancy. Fiona lives with her dad and little brother here in Bozeman. Her mom
      lives in Hawaii.  At fifteen, Fiona traveled to Livingston with a friend who opted for an
      abortion. A year later, at sixteen, Fiona found herself in the same position; she was
      pregnant. Following is Fiona’s story, as told via interviews with Fiona, her dad, Roger, and
      her mother, Mary Jo. Please note, Fiona’s boyfriend, the names of his parents and the
      adoptive parents, as well as the beautiful baby girl have all been withheld to protect
      everyone’s privacy, to ensure the necessary boundaries for the adopted child and to help
      sustain the close relationship between all of the parties involved.</p>

    <p>How did you hear about ZoeCare?</p>
    <p style="color: red;">My dad told me about Zoe. I’d also heard of it before when a
      friend of mine was pregnant the previous year, and I’ve heard the radio commercials. I really
      liked going to Zoe.  The staff and nurses were all very welcoming. I never felt pressured or
      judged, and I felt really loved.</p>
    <p>How did Fiona tell you she was pregnant?</p>
    <p style="color: blue;">Roger: I will always remember the evening she told me. “Dad, I have something to tell you
      and I am scared.” “Well what is it?” “I want you to ask me questions.” “Ok, did you break the
      law?” “No.” “Does it involve a boy?” “Yes.” At this point, I knew. In the previous year, or
      so, we had had several discussions about sex. Fiona knew where I stood, which was basically
      the risk of STDs was too high and to delay at least into adulthood, and then, only in a
      steady relationship. Once I had established the details; who the father was, that the tests
      were positive, that yes, she had been to Zoe's for an ultrasound, and yes, she was going to
      keep the baby, I found myself dealing with a sense of betrayal. “Why didn't you listen to
      me?” I thought she had agreed to abstain. I was upset. But I could quickly see that being
      upset was driving a wedge between us. Fiona didn't need a lecture on the nature of her
      decision; she knew she had messed up. What she needed, more than ever, was to know that I was
      going to be there for her. So, despite my distress over the whole matter, I reached out to
      her and told her that I loved her, and that I would support her through this process.</p>
    <p style="color: green;">Mary Jo: She sent me a text saying, “I’m pregnant. I’m sorry.” I responded, “There’s no need
      to be sorry.”</p>

    <p>A number of young women choose abortion or emergency contraception. We’re so very thankful
      that you chose life. What influenced your decision to carry your child to term and to give
      the gift of life to a grateful couple?</p>
    <p style="color: red;">It’s actually a fairly involved story. I did take Plan B approximately
      one hour after the condom we were using broke. It didn’t work, and I knew I was pregnant. I
      felt like a light was on inside of me. I just said to myself, “Ok God, I get it.” My dad is
      very pro-life, so is my boyfriend, and his parents are pro-life too. I’d also seen an episode
      of 16 and Pregnant when I was about 13, about a couple named Caitlyn and Tyler. It’s the only
      episode where the couple chooses to make an adoption plan. I knew then that if I were ever in
      the same situation, I’d choose adoption for my baby.</p>
    <p>Roger, were you pro-life from the beginning?</p>
    <p style="color: blue;">Yes, I have been pro-life for as long as I can remember.</p>
    <p>Mary Jo, were you pro-life from the beginning?</p>
    <p style="color: green;">Abortion is one of the most multi-faceted dilemmas of our times - stretching across
      religious, political, cultural and ethical arenas. I do not consider myself pro-life as this
      phrase is generally used and understood.</p>
    <p>What events in your life and Fiona’s helped you collectively choose life? </p>
    <p style="color: blue;">Roger: I believe, for Fiona, it was always her understanding that, if she should get
      pregnant, carrying the child to term would be the only option because she understood that
      this was not her child. Meaning, she did not own it and, therefore, have the right to
      terminate its life.</p>
    <p style="color: green;">Mary Jo: This was primarily Fiona's decision to make. My only counsel,
      when she told me that she was going to continue the pregnancy, was that this needed to be her
      decision if she was going to be able to sustain her strength throughout an inevitably rocky
      experience.</p>
    <p style="color: green;">From the beginning, I understood that this was Fiona's journey and
      that I would give her my unconditional support. I assured her that I would do my best to
      stand beside her, but not take charge; to offer opinions and guidance, but to respect her
      role as ultimate decision maker with regard to this experience.</p>
    <p>Did Zoe help you with your adoption plan?</p>
    <p style="color: red;">Yes, they put me in touch with Lutheran Social Services. They were very
      affirming, supportive, and helpful when I told them about my decision to go with an adoption
      plan.</p>
    <p>Tell us about the adoption; how you found, chose, and worked with the selected family.</p>
    <p style="color: red;">My counselor, at Lutheran Social Services, gave us profiles from six couples. We both liked
      the one file. They provided lots of photos, and bullets with their interests, likes,
      dislikes, etc. We immediately really liked them and chose to meet them.</p>
    <p>How did your parents respond to your adoption decision?</p>
    <p style="color: red;">My dad was really proud of me and supportive. Both of my parents were
      very supportive. My little brother, Oliver, really wanted to keep the baby, but he understood
      that adoption was the best option for everyone.</p>
    <p style="color: green;">Mary Jo: It was very important to me that Fiona make a fully informed
      decision regarding open adoption. She had no way of knowing how painful it would be to
      relinquish her role as a parent and I did not want her to regret her decision. So, I made
      sure she knew that keeping her baby was also a viable option, and that her dad and I would
      support her if this was what she truly wanted.</p>
    <p style="color: green;">As Fiona's pregnancy advanced, I was keenly aware of the layers of
      anticipatory grief - for myself and for Fiona. As my role as a grandmother was becoming more
      real, I would experience waves of grief thinking about Fiona's baby being raised by another
      family; how it would feel for me, and how it might feel for her.</p>
      <img src="/static/img/fiona/couch.jpg" alt="couch.jpg" class="img-rounded pull-right
      img-story-right" />
    <p style="color: green;">I shared this openly with Fiona, not with the intention of trying to
      change her decision regarding the adoption but, so that she could really see all sides of
      it. Being honest and vulnerable with Fiona, in this way, deepened our relationship and
      allowed me to trust more completely that this entire experience was divinely guided, and that
      my daughter, granddaughter, and myself would each be well cared for, whatever unfolded.</p>
    <p>Roger, please tell us about the interaction with the boyfriend’s parents?</p>
    <p style="color: blue;">Fortunately his parents were always totally supportive of the decision
      not to abort. They would not have wanted it any other way.  Mary Jo: I have a great deal of
      respect for everyone. Fiona's pregnancy served as a catalyst for many relationships to form,
      and I think that everyone who had a part to play was touched deeply. Everyone truly embraced
      Fiona. During her long labor at the hospital her boyfriend hardly left her side and his
      family kept a constant vigil in the waiting room.</p>
    <p>How did your friends, peers, teachers and others respond to your adoption decision?</p>
    <p style="color: red;">It’s funny. I got a lot of different responses. A lot of people left me
      in the dust when they found out I was pregnant. I can completely understand that they just
      didn't know how to handle it. Most people don't know how to talk to a pregnant teen which
      became VERY clear during my pregnancy. Although I did have some social struggles, there were
      some people that I could not have even imagined going through this without.  First of all, my
      therapist Flora, she helped me through all my road bumps and really helped me prepare for
      giving my daughter to her new family. I never felt judged by her, and she was always at my
      side.  Secondly, my friend Ashley, she was my shield at school. If anyone ever had anything
      mean to say about me, she was always right there to defend me and cheer me up. She told me
      how proud of me she was all the time, and was one of the only people I shared everything with
      during my pregnancy and journey afterwards.</p>

    <p style="color: red;">Thirdly, my friend Margot. I met Margot during my pregnancy through Lady
      Hawk basketball. We were managers together. Margot became one of my best friends, to say the
      least. She always made me feel so loved and cared about. I knew I could go to her with
      anything and still can. Margot is truly an amazing person.</p>
    <p style="color: red;">Lastly, I would like to thank the Lady Hawk JV and Varsity basketball
      teams. When I was managing that season, I was visibly pregnant. Sometimes, at away games, I
      would get mean stares or hear people making negative comments about me. Despite this, I felt
      completely surrounded by the most inspiring people, so it didn't even faze me. Thank you for
      loving and accepting me. I learned so much from all of you and I loved cheering you on.</p>
    <p style="color: red;">Also my boyfriend deserves a lot more credit than he received. Although we had a difficult
      couple of months when I first told him I was pregnant, both he and his parents were very
      supportive. He came to every doctor’s visit with me. He gained lots of respect from a number
      of people. He just really matured, and the niceness that was always there became more evident
      to everyone.</p>
    <p>What counsel do you have for other young women who may be facing an unplanned pregnancy?</p>
    <p style="color: red;">It will most likely feel very overwhelming, but it’s so important to
      know that you are strong enough to face any option, because no option will be easy. People
      may try to tell you negative things but try not to let it hurt your heart. Start by going to
      ZoeCare. The ladies at ZoeCare will explain all of your options. They’re very understanding,
      really good listeners, and you will feel completely loved and not judged at all.  Would you
      recommend adoption to your friends and other young women/couples? I believe adoption is the
      greatest gift for everyone involved. Your baby is receiving the gift of everything that you
      could not provide for her, the adoptive family is receiving the gift of life, and you are
      receiving the gift of unimaginable strength that you would never gain in any other
      situation. So yes, I would recommend adoption. It is a gift more valuable than anything, but
      it is hard. I live every day feeling as though part of my heart is gone. But I am at peace
      knowing she is getting the life she deserves. It’s so affirming for me to see that we’re both
      living the life God has given us. I’m living my life, and seeing her live her life helps me
      know each day that making an adoption plan was the best possible outcome for both of us.</p>
    <p>Do you have a personal faith position that helped influence your decision for life?</p>
    <p style="color: red">I believe in God and angels. I believe they watched over me through this
      entire process. I would not have been faced with this unless God knew that I had the strength
      to go on this journey. Abortion is something I personally could not go through with, but I
      understand that some people think that it is their only option. I hope they can hear my
      story, be encouraged, and consider adoption.</p>  <img src="/static/img/fiona/run.jpg"

    <p>How do you hope Fiona’s story will impact her peers, your peers, and persons who will find
      themselves in a similar situation?</p>
    <p style="color: green;">Mary Jo: First and foremost, I am grateful Fiona turned to Roger and
      me for support right away, and that she trusted her relationship with us enough to do so.</p>
    <p style="color: green;">Unquestionably, Fiona faced fear, anxiety, and avoidance along the
      path she chose. It was not an easy nine months in her life. But witnessing the culmination of
      her love and determination as she labored and gave birth to her daughter was truly a gift
      beyond words. Perhaps one of the most grace- filled experiences a mother and young daughter
      could ever share.</p>
    <p style="color: blue;">Roger: I sincerely hope that the decisions Fiona made, demonstrated by
      her actions, will act as a positive role model for others who find themselves in a similar
      situation. Although this may be a tremendous story, it has not been an easy path for her. She
      has had to face some pretty challenging events in her life, prior to her pregnancy, which has
      definitely played a pivotal role in her ability to navigate through this period. She was
      brought up to see life as a journey and that the tests along the way are there to make us
      stronger. Some might see her as a hero. However, heroes don't think they are doing anything
      unusual. Unfortunately, what she has demonstrated is unusual in this day and age, but I hope
      the example of her story will make it far less unusual. In fact, I hope that this will be the
      new normal.  This is a story that I would never have wished for...to have my teenage daughter
      go through a pregnancy followed by an adoption. However, having been through it, I am
      eternally grateful for the opportunities that it delivered. I am a father of four children,
      and each of them came with a gift. Fiona’s child, my biological granddaughter, is no
      exception. Her gift was to bring me closer to my daughter, Fiona. It wasn't easy parenting
      her through the pregnancy, but when is parenting a teenager ever easy?</p>
    <p>Fiona, Roger and Mary Jo – thank you for sharing your story with us. There’s so much more to
      this ongoing and unfolding story of life. Fiona and her boyfriend do not have to know the
      pain, anguish, and trauma of aborting their child. Two sets of parents did not lose a
      granddaughter, and the blessing of life has been given to a beautiful baby girl and an
      extraordinary Bozeman couple.</p>
