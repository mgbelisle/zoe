      <h2>Pregnancy Testing</h2>
    </div>
    <p>ZoeCare offers FREE pregnancy tests that are 99% accurate. You
      will be provided with the result of your pregnancy test
      including a verification form you may take with you. If you have
      a positive pregnancy test, you may schedule a FREE ultrasound to
      determine the status of your pregnancy.</p>
    <p>There are three viable pregnancy tests, including:</p>
    1.
    <a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#pregnancy-testing-urine" data-int-href>
      Urine Testing
    </a>
    <div id="pregnancy-testing-urine" class="collapse">
      <div class="accordion-inner">
	Urine Testing is offered FREE at ZoeCare. Home testing can
	be done with the purchase of a pregnancy testing kit at drug
	stores, most grocery stores, and some department stores.
	The cost is about $10 to $20.  Accuracy varies depending on
	how long it has been since the last menstrual period and
	validity of the test.  The urine testing at ZoeCare is 99%
	accurate if your menstrual period is one day late, and
	sometimes it will indicate a pregnancy prior to noticing a
	late period.

    <a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#pregnancy-testing-blood" data-int-href>
      Blood Testing
    </a>
    <div id="pregnancy-testing-blood" class="accordion-body collapse">
      <div class="accordion-inner">
	The blood test is called serum beta hCG.  It measures the same
	hormone that the urine test measures.  The cost is about $50.
	It will indicate a pregnancy only a day or two sooner than the
	urine testing.  A serum beta hCG test must be ordered by a
	physician.  To be completely accurate in determining a viable
	(healthy) pregnancy, two blood tests must be done about two or
	three days apart, which doubles the cost.  ZoeCare offers this
	testing at no charge, but ONLY after certain criteria have
	been met. Those criteria can only be determined by an
	ultrasound.  This is very rare.  Blood testing for routine
	pregnancy confirmation is not medically indicated.

    <a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#pregnancy-testing-ultrasound" data-int-href>
      Ultrasound
    </a>
    <div id="pregnancy-testing-ultrasound" class="accordion-body collapse">
      <div class="accordion-inner">
	<p>ZoeCare offer FREE limited obstetrical ultrasounds with
	  the medical purpose of confirming a viable (healthy)
	  pregnancy.  A limited ultrasound is recommended because
	  the urine test can be positive for up to two weeks even
	  when a miscarriage has occurred.  An ultrasound is a
	  medical procedure using sound waves to view a pregnancy.
	  It is painless and has been used in obstetrics for over 40
	  years without harm or ill effect to mother or baby.</p>
	<p>If you are considering an abortion an ultrasound will
	  answer to important questions:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>It will confirm a viable (healthy) pregnancy.  This is
	    important because there is no need to pay for an abortion,
	    or undergo the emotional and physical trauma experienced
	    by many women who abort, if you have incurred a natural
	    miscarriage.  One in four or five early pregnancies end in
	    a natural miscarriage.</li>
	  <li>An ultrasound will provide accurate dating of the
	    pregnancy.  Accurate age of the baby is important in
	    determining what type of abortion is medically necessary.
	    There may be a considerable difference in cost between a
	    chemical (medication/pills) and a surgical abortion.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The ultrasounds at ZoeCare are performed by registered
	  nurses with advanced ultrasound (sonographer) training.
	  All ZoeCare ultrasounds are reviewed by a medical
	  doctor.</p>

	  I already tested posive at home and just want an
	  ultrasound. Now what?
	</a>
	<div id="pregnancy-testing-already-positive" class="collapse">
	  <div class="accordion-inner">
	    If you have taken a home pregnancy test prior to your
	    appointment and tested positive, we still require you
	    to take a pregnancy test at ZoeCare. Our pregnancy
	    tests are more accurate than most home tests because
	    they are medical quality tests.  It is important for
	    us to confirm your pregnancy as well as the
	    approximate gestational age of our child prior to
	    performing an ultrasound test.
