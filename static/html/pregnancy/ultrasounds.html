      <p>A prenatal ultrasound test uses high-frequency sound waves, inaudible to the human ear, that 
	are transmitted through the abdomen via a device called a transducer to look at the inside of 
	the abdomen. With prenatal ultrasound, the echoes are recorded and transformed into video
	or photographic images of your baby.</p>

	  <p>The ultrasound can be used during pregnancy to show images of the baby, amniotic sac, 
	    placenta, and ovaries. Major anatomical abnormalities or birth defects are visible on an 
	    ultrasound.</p>
	  <p>Most prenatal ultrasound procedures are performed topically, or on the surface of the skin, 
	    using a gel as a conductive medium to aid in the image quality. However, a transvaginal 
	    ultrasound is an alternative procedure in which a tubular probe is inserted into the vaginal 
	    canal. This method of ultrasound produces an image quality that is greatly enhanced, but it is 
	    not a common prenatal procedure. However, it may be used early in pregnancy to get a clearer 
	    view of the uterus or ovaries if a problem is suspected. It may also be used early in pregnancy
	    to determine how far along you are in your pregnancy (gestational age).</p>

      <h2>Ultrasounds</h2>
      Answers to Many of Your Questions
    </div>
    <p>If you tested positive on a ZoeCare administered pregnancy test
      you may receive a FREE limited ultrasound if the estimated
      gestational age is at least 6 to 7 weeks.  If you are underage,
      parental consent may be required to perform an ultrasound. Some
      medical considerations may preclude or postpone an
      ultrasound. An ultrasound can determine if you have a viable
      (healthy) pregnancy and the gestational age (how far along you
      are).</p>
    <p>We do a limited ultrasound here at ZoeCare that provides the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify a pregnancy</li>
      <li>Confirm that the pregnancy is in the uterus, and is not an ectopic or tubal pregnancy</li>
      <li>Take measurements of the baby to see how far along you are</li>
      <li>Measure the baby's heart rate to determine a viable pregnancy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A diagnostic ultrasound is performed at 20 weeks and is more
      involved. It is ordered and done by your health care provider
      and not by ZoeCare.</p>
    <h4>Is Prenatal Ultrasound Safe?</h4>
    <p>Studies have shown ultrasound is not hazardous. There are no
      harmful side effects to you or your baby. In addition,
      ultrasound does not use radiation, as X-ray tests do.</p>

    <h4>What is an ectopic pregnancy? Do I need to know if I have an ectopic pregnancy?</h4>
    <p>An ultrasound is also a diagnostic tool for determining whether
      or not a pregnancy is safe. A fertilized egg in the fallopian
      tubes (an ectopic pregnancy) is NOT safe. A woman diagnosed with
      an ectopic pregnancy needs to seek emergency medical
      attention. If your ultrasounds reveals signs of an ectopic
      pregnancy, you will be referred by our staff to seek immediate
      medical attention.</p>
    <h4>How can I know when I got pregnant?</h4>
    <p>If you donâ€™t remember the date of your last period or are not
      sure when you may have conceived, an ultrasound can provide an
      accurate measurement of the age or your baby. It is very
      important to know how far along you are in your pregnancy if you
      are considering an abortion. Gestational age of the baby will
      determine what abortion methods are available to you and enable
      you to know the risks associated with each prescribed method.</p>
