      <h2>Ultrasounds</h2>
      Answers to Many of Your Questions
    </div>
    <p>If you tested positive on a ZoeCare administered pregnancy test
      you may receive a FREE limited ultrasound if the estimated
      gestational age is at least 6 to 7 weeks.  If you are underage,
      parental consent may be required to perform an ultrasound. Some
      medical considerations may preclude or postpone an
      ultrasound. An ultrasound can determine if you have a viable
      (healthy) pregnancy and the gestational age (how far along you
      are).</p>
    <p>We do a limited ultrasound here at ZoeCare that provides the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify a pregnancy</li>
      <li>Confirm that the pregnancy is in the uterus, and is not an ectopic or tubal pregnancy</li>
      <li>Take measurements of the baby to see how far along you are</li>
      <li>Measure the baby's heart rate to determine a viable pregnancy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A diagnostic ultrasound is performed at 20 weeks and is more
      involved. It is ordered and done by your health care provider
      and not by ZoeCare.</p>
    <h4>Is Prenatal Ultrasound Safe?</h4>
    <p>Studies have shown ultrasound is not hazardous. There are no
      harmful side effects to you or your baby. In addition,
      ultrasound does not use radiation, as X-ray tests do.</p>
