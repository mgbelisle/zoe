	  Yes! You can get pregnant the first time you have sex. There

	  If you have intercourse slightly before or during those
	  days, the chance of pregnancy can occur. If you want to find
	  out when you are most fertile come in and talk to one of our
	  nurses. There are also many websites and books that help you
	  learn more about your body’s fertility by monitoring your

	  Sometimes tests simply do not take (perform) correctly. It

	  pregnancy.

	  Abortion is a medical procedure (resulting in death of the

	  are associated physical and mental risks. Studies suggest an
	  increased risk of breast cancer later in life; other studies
	  suggest that women with reservations prior to getting an
	  abortion will often suffer from Post Abortion Syndrome (or
	  PAS). Even if you're already committed to having an
	  abortion, don't rush in as you may not need it! About 25% of
	  all pregnancies end naturally. Why go through the pain and
