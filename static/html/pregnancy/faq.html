      <div id="faq-accordion-3" class="accordion-body collapse">
	<div class="accordion-inner">
	  Yes! You can get pregnant the first time you have sex. There
	  are only a few days a month that you are actually fertile.
	  If you have intercourse slightly before or during those
	  days, the chance of pregnancy can occur. If you want to find
	  out when you are most fertile come in and talk to one of our
	  nurses. There are also many websites and books that help you
	  learn more about your body’s fertility by monitoring your
	  period, body temperature as well as your mucus.

	  Sometimes tests simply do not take (perform) correctly. It
