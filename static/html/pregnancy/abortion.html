	<h4>Verify Your Pregnancy</h4>
	<p>Before making an appointment for any type of abortion, you
	  will need to verify you are actually pregnant. You will also
	  need to know how far along you are in the pregnancy. Even if
	  you are experiencing pregnancy symptoms or have taken a home
	  pregnancy test that was positive, you should get a medically
	  accurate, lab-quality pregnancy test. You can get
	  a <strong><em>free</em> lab-quality pregnancy test at
	    ZoeCare</strong>. Our tests are 99% accurate.</p>

    <h4><em>Free</em> Abortion Information</h4>
    <p>Different abortion methods are used at different stages of
      pregnancy and different risks are involved in each procedure.
      ZoeCare can walk you through all the facts for each procedure,
      so that you can make an informed decision. Feel free
      to <a href="/contact"

      today to meet with one of our patient advocates or a ZoeCare
      nurse who can provide you with necessary information, listen to
      your concerns and answer your questions.</p>
    <h4><em>Free</em> Ultrasound</h4>
    <p>Did you know that statistically 1 in 4 early pregnancies end in
      natural miscarriage? If you have a positive pregnancy test at
      Zoecare, you may be a candidate for a free, limited ultrasound to
      determine the status and gestational age of your pregnancy. This
      information may help you with your decision-making considerations.</p>
    <h4>Previous Abortion?</h4>
    <p>It’s important to understand that having more than one abortion
      brings increased health risks and possible fertility
      implications. At ZoeCare, our trained medical staff and patient
      advocates, can talk with you about your concerns and give you
      valuable information so you can make an informed, knowledgeable
      decision about whether having an abortion is right for you.</p>

	<h4>The Abortion Pill, RU-486</h4>
	<p>It’s important to know the facts before you undergo a
	  chemical abortion via
	  RU-486.<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/women/az/tss.htm"
		    ext-href>*</a> RU-486, like other drugs, has potentially
	  serious side effects and complications.</p>
	<p>You should not take RU-486 if you have:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>high blood pressure</li>
	  <li>heart disease</li>
	  <li>bleeding problem[s]</li>
	  <li>anemia</li>
	  <li>uncontrolled diabetes</li>
	</ul>
      </div>
      <div class="span6">
	<h4>Complications</h4>
	<p>The FDA has released reports of complications including death resulting from hemorrhage (excessive bleeding), serious and sometimes fatal infections, and missed diagnoses of ectopic pregancy.</p>
	<p>Before taking RU-486 make sure you follow the two recommendations made by the FDA.</p>
	<p>Get an <a href="/pregnancy/ultrasound">ultrasound</a> to determine if the pregnancy is in the uterus. RU-486 has no effect on an ectopic pregnancy which can be fatal if undetected.</p>

	  <p>Make sure you have access to Emergency Care including a surgical facility in case an emergency surgical abortion becomes necessary. </p>
	  <p>If you cannot get an ultrasound prior to taking RU-486 and you do not have access to emergency medical care, you are at even greater risk. Ignoring the use guidelines for RU-486 makes this choice much less safe.</p>
