<h4>Pregnant? Concerned about an STI?</h4>
<p>Are you facing an unplanned pregnancy? Do you suspect you have a sexually transmitted infection?</p>
<p>Don’t panic! The possibility of an unplanned pregnancy or STI can generate a lot of stress and usher in serious concerns 
  about your future. If you’re enrolled at MSU, Gallatin College or any other education program or high school, you have 
  unique concerns as a student. ZoeCare can help you get answers to your questions.</p>
<h4>Am I Really Pregnant?</h4>
<p>Missing your period can create some stress if you are not planning a pregnancy. However, if you are sexually active, it 
  is possible to become pregnant even if you are using some form of contraception. It is important to confirm pregnancy 
  early with an accurate pregnancy test.</p>
<h4>Free Ultrasound</h4>
<p>If you have a positive pregnancy test at ZoeCare, you may be eligible for a free, limited ultrasound. An ultrasound will 
  tell you how far along you are and whether your pregnancy is viable (healthy). All of this information will help you know 
  more about your pregnancy and the options available so you can make a knowledgeable and informed decision.</p>
<h4>Many Early Pregnancies End in Miscarriage</h4>
<p>You should know that many early pregnancies result in natural miscarriage. An ultrasound will help determine if your 
  pregnancy is viable (healthy) or if you’re going to miscarry naturally, at which point an abortion is simply an unnecessary 
  expense. All ZoeCare ultrasounds are reviewed by a physician.</p>
<h4>Under Pressure?</h4>
<p>An unplanned pregnancy in college or high school can oftentimes bring added pressure from a partner or boyfriend 
  who is also worried about his own future. You may even feel some pressure from a parent or other guardian who 
  had different plans for you. If you are feeling pressured to have an abortion and want someone to talk to, make an 
  appointment to speak with one of our client advocates. Every situation is unique, but please know you are not alone. We 
  are here to help. We can help you understand your options, answer your questions to help you make a knowledgeable 
  and informed decision that’s right for you.</p>
<h4>Considering an Abortion?</h4>
<p>Every year ZoeCare sees women from high school and college campuses in southwestern Montana who are considering 
  an abortion as the only answer to an unplanned pregnancy. If you’re considering making an appointment at a Montana 
  abortion clinic you deserve to have the best possible information regarding your rights as a client and to be fully 
  informed about abortion as a medical procedure. Feel free to make an appointment or call and talk with one of our 
  client advocates or nurses who can answer your questions about abortion procedures and risks.</p>
<h4>You Have Time to Make Informed Decisions</h4>
<p>An unplanned pregnancy necessitates a need for information, a plan and a decision. We understand that as you 
  contemplate your options you will have questions.</p>
<p>How do I get medical care? Can I stay in school? How do I finish my education? What will my parents say? Will this affect 
  my scholarship? Can I (we) provide for a child?</p>
