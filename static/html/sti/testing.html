      <h2>STD/STI Testing</h2>
      Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) and/or Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)
    </div>
    <p>All sexually active individuals that are not in a monogamous
      relationship should be tested for a sexually transmitted
      infection (STI) and/or a sexually transmitted disease (STD).  If
      you are sexually active and have more than one partner you are
      at risk for STIs. STIs are very common.</p>
    <p>We are currently testing for
      both <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/gon-fact-sheet-june-2012.pdf"
      data-ext-href>gonorrhea</a>
      and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/chlam-fact-sheet-dec-2012.pdf"
      data-ext-href>chlamydia</a> at no cost to the patient. There are
      many different types of STIs. Call and talk to our nurse to
      determine the type of test you need.</p>
