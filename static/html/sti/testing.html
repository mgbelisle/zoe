      <h2>STD/STI Testing</h2>
      Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) and/or Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)
    </div>
    <p>All sexually active individuals that are not in a monogamous
      relationship should be tested for a sexually transmitted
      infection (STI) and/or a sexually transmitted disease (STD).  If
      you are sexually active and have more than one partner you are
      at risk for STIs. STIs are very common.</p>
    <p>We are currently testing for
      both <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/gon-fact-sheet-june-2012.pdf"
      data-ext-href>gonorrhea</a>
      and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/chlam-fact-sheet-dec-2012.pdf"
      data-ext-href>chlamydia</a> at no cost to the patient. There are
      many different types of STIs. Call and talk to our nurse to
      determine the type of test you need.</p>
    <p>Statistically 1 in 3 people who have had more than one sex
      partner will be diagnosed with an STI each year. The CDC
      estimates the total number of STD’s in the U.S. at 110 million
      infections, costing almost $16 billion annually in medical
      expenses.</p>
    <p>Most STD’s are asymptomatic, therefore the majority of people
      who have an STD don’t know they’re infected.  If untreated these
      infections can cause numerous health issues including
      infertility, PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease), cancer and/or
      other complications or diseases.</p>
