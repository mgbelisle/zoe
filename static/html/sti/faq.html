	  STIs are spread through skin to skin contact, vaginal, anal and oral sex. Skin to skin contact, does not 
	  mean just walking up to someone and touching them. Skin to skin contact means coming in contact with 
	  an infected area. HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) and Herpes are spread through skin to skin contact, this 
	  means actual sexual intercourse is not required to contract Herpes or HPV. Other STIs like Chlamydia, 
	  Gonorrhea, Syphilis, HIV, Hepatitis B are ALL spread through bodily fluids like blood, urine, semen, and 
	  vaginal fluid. These fluids are exchanged during oral, vaginal and anal sex.
