	  All sexually active individuals that are not in a monogamous

	  infection (STI) and/or a sexually transmitted disease (STD).
	  If you are sexually active and have more than one partner
	  you are at risk for STIs. STI’s are very common.

	<div class="accordion-inner">
	  <p>Symptoms are not always obvious, and often there are no
	  symptoms at all.  Even if you have no symptoms, you can
	  still pass the infection to other partners.  Women are more
	  likely NOT to have symptoms.  If left untreated, the STI
	  (sexual transmitted infection) can become more severe and
	  also increase your risk of acquiring another STI.</p>
	  <p>Some general symptoms include:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Painful or burning sensation when urinating</li>
	    <li>Thick, cloudy, or bloody discharge from penis or vagina</li>
	    <li>Pain during sexual intercourse in women</li>
	    <li>Painful or swollen testicles in men</li>
	    <li>Itching in the genital area, vagina, penis, or anal area</li>
	    <li>Lesions like warts or ulcers in genital area</li>
	    <li>Sore throat</li>
	    <li>Fever</li>
	    <li>Fatigue</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Remember there are no symptoms in infected persons 50% of
	    the time. The percentage is higher for women.</p>

	<div class="accordion-inner">
	  STI's are spread through skin to skin contact, vaginal, anal and oral sex. Skin to skin contact, does not 
	  mean just walking up to someone and touching them. Skin to skin contact means coming in contact with 
	  an infected area. HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) and Herpes are spread through skin to skin contact, this 
	  means actual sexual intercourse is not required to contract Herpes or HPV. Other STIs like Chlamydia, 
	  Gonorrhea, Syphilis, HIV, Hepatitis B are ALL spread through bodily fluids like blood, urine, semen, and 
	  vaginal fluid. These fluids are exchanged during oral, vaginal and anal sex.
