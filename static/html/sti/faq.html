	<div class="accordion-inner">
	  <p>STIs are spread through skin to skin contact, vaginal,
	    anal and oral sex. Skin to skin contact, does not mean
	    just walking up to someone and touching them. Skin to skin
	    contact means coming in contact with an infected area. HPV
	    (Human Papilloma Virus) and Herpes are spread through skin
	    to skin contact, this means actual sexual intercourse is
	    not required to contract Herpes or HPV. Other STIs like
	    Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, HIV, Hepatitis B are ALL
	    spread through bodily fluids like blood, urine, semen, and
	    vaginal fluid. These fluids are exchanged during oral,
	    vaginal and anal sex.</p>
